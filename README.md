> Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and focus your eyes on 
> something at least 20 feet away.

> Many of us spend a good deal of our time staring at screens from 
> laptops, computers, smartphones, gaming systems and television. 
> This can put a lot of strain on our eyes and cause eye fatigue. 
> When using your screens give your eyes a break.
